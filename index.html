    <h2> Platform </h2>
    
    <h3> National Voter referendum/veto. </h3>
    <p>
      In many states across the country, we have shown that voter referendums work. 
      By extending this right to the federal level we can reduce the power of the presidency and increase the power of the people.
      For far too long, the people of the United States have rightly felt powerless in the workings of our government.
      While I am in office, you the people will have control over as much presidential power as possible.
      I am in favor of limiting government, and I believe the best way to do so is to give the people the power to limit it.
      This is not a revolution. It&#39;s an evolution.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Constitutional Amendment </h3>
    <p>
      America must enshrine the national voter referendum and voter veto into the U. S. Constitution, and enable rules for limiting presidential power.
      What exact form this Constitutional Amendment takes will itself be decided through a national voter referendum.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Why run for president? </h3>
    <p>
      We the people of the United States, are not children.
      The founding fathers envisioned a government by the people, for the people, and of the people.
      They did the best they could given the constraints of the era.
      But representative government is archaic and insulting.
      Regardless of the political party, we mostly have egocentric assholes holding elective office.
      Every president, regardless of party, does not relinquish authority.
      From the George Washington to Joe Biden, each president has sought to consolidate and amass more power.
      My goal is to move the United States into the 21st century.
      We will set up a system for every citizen to have a constant voice in the decisions that affect our country.
      Let&#39;s get together and work towards a more perfect union.
    </p>

    <h3> What will I do as president. </h3>
    <p>
      I will do what you want.
      The first thing I will do is enable the American people to sign up to vote securely online.
      Any legislation that is passed by the House and Senate will be put to a vote.
      At times, we will put the vote out prior to the house or senate vote so that they can see what will occur.
      We will put forth our own legislation.
    </p>

    <h2> Campaign </h2>
    <h3> I&#39;m not taking any donations at all. </h3>

      I&#39;m not going to campaign. I&#39;ve got ranch work to do and a regular job.
      Campaigning and asking for donors leads to mental people running for president.
      It&#39;s a sickening activity.
      I mean, what kind of person really wants to do that?
      In the earlier years of presidential campaigning, the candidates did not go out and glad hand.
      They stayed at home and took visitor's questions there.
      All I ask is for people to volunteer, get together and create petitions to submit for listing me on their state&#39;s presidential ballot.
      That&#39;s it.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Who am I </h2>
    <div class="image-left" >
      <img src="images/LuttrellGardenAtDusk.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
      My name is Michael Luttrell.
      I am a rancher and a software engineer. 
      I currently reside on a small ranch in Cottonwood, Arizona. 
      I&#39;ve been a musician since I was 10 years old.
      I don&#39;t actually want to be president, I want to reduce the power of the presidency.
      No one else seemed to have any platform remotely similar.
      So reluctantly, I have decided to put this rather simple idea into action.
      I am not running as a member of either party and my personal views do not matter. 
      I will not be making the decisions as president.
      You, the people of the United States will.
      My job, as president, will be to enable the citizens of this country to do so.
