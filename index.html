    <h2> Platform </h2>
    
    <h3> National Voter referendum and veto. </h3>
    <p>
      Many states across the country have shown that voter referendums work. 
      By extending this right to the federal level we can reduce the power of the presidency and increase the power of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For far too long, the people of the United States have rightly felt powerless in the workings of our government.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I am in office, you the people will have control over as much presidential power as possible.
      I am in favor of limiting government, and I believe the best way to do so is to give the people the power to limit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a revolution. It&#39;s an evolution.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Constitutional Amendment </h3>
    <p>
      America must enshrine the national voter referendum and voter veto into the U. S. Constitution, and enable rules for limiting presidential power.
      What exact form this Constitutional Amendment takes will itself be decided through a national voter referendum.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Why run for president? </h3>
    <p>
      We the people of the United States, are not children.
      The founding fathers envisioned a government by the people, for the people, and of the people.
      They did the best they could given the constraints of the era.
    </p>
    <p>
      But representative government is archaic and insulting.
      Regardless of the political party, we mostly have egocentric jackasses holding elective office.
      From George Washington to Joe Biden, each individual who has held the office of the president has sought to consolidate and amass more power.
    </p>
    <p>
      They declare executive orders like we live in a monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to move the United States into the 21st century.
      We will set up a system for every citizen to have a constant voice in the decisions that affect our country.
      Let&#39;s get together and work towards a more perfect union.
    </p>

    <h3> What will I do as president? </h3>
    <strong> I will do what <em>YOU</em> want.</strong>
    <p>
      The first thing I will do is enable the American people to sign up to vote securely online.
      Any legislation that is passed by the House and Senate will be put to a vote.
      At times, we will put the vote out prior to the House or Senate vote so that they can see what will occur.
      We will put forth our own legislation.
    </p>

    <h2> Campaign </h2>
    <h3> I&#39;m not taking any donations at all. </h3>

    <p>
      I&#39;m not going to campaign. I&#39;ve got chores to do and a regular job.
      I do not want big donors and I do not want small donors.
      Keep your money.
      Campaigning and asking for donors leads to vain people running for president.
      It&#39;s a sickening activity.
      I mean, what kind of person really wants to do that?
      Did you know that in the earlier years of presidential campaigning, the candidates did not go out and glad hand?
      They stayed at home and took visitor's questions there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be filing with the  
      FEC as a candidate, once I meet these requirements.
    </p>

    <div class="quote-block">
      <p>
        <em >
        An individual running for federal office must register and file financial reports when he or she raises or spends more than $5,000 in contributions or expenditures.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em >
        Federal candidates must designate a principal campaign committee. This campaign committee takes in contributions and makes expenditures for the candidate’s campaign. Candidates may designate additional authorized campaign committees to help raise and spend funds, but only a principal campaign committee is required.

      I mean, for real, it's all about money for these guys.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will work to meet the requirements to be listed as an independent presidential candidate on all 50 states.
      If you'd like to help me acheive this goal, contact me. I&#39;d like to work with you.
      That&#39;s it.

    <h2> Who am I? </h2>

    <div class="image-left" >
      <img src="images/LuttrellGardenAtDusk.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
      My name is Michael Luttrell.
      I am a goat farmer and a software engineer. 
      I currently reside on the Verde River in Central Arizona. 
      I&#39;ve been a musician since I was 10 years old.
      I didn&#39;t want to run for president, I want to reduce the power of the presidency.
      I want to bring the idea of self-government to a modern sense and no other candidates' platform accomplishes this.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no other candidate that has a platform remotely similar.
      Why would they? They are seeking power, not seeking to empower you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every other candidate for every single position in every single election wants to make decisions for you. <br />
      They think they know better than you. <br />
      They think they are more qualified than you. <br />
      I think they&#39;re full of it
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought about this idea of a National Voter Referendum for many years and.
      So reluctantly, I have decided to put this idea into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not running as a member of either party and my personal views do not matter. 
      If we acheive the goal of a National Voter Referendum Constitutional Amendment, I promise you, I will not run for re-election.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not be making the decisions as president. <br />
      You, the people of the United States will. <br />
      My job, as president, will be to enable the citizens of this country to do so. <br />
    </p>

    <hr class="clear-it" />
    <h2>Coming soon</h2>
    <p> Here we will soon provide the requirements for each state, territory and the District of Columbia for being listed as a candidate in the general election. </p>
    <!-- how will we do this -->
