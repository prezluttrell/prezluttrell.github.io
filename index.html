Hello World!

¡Hola a todo el mundo!


Platform

National Voter referendum/veto.
In many states across the country, we have shown that voter referendums work. 
Reduce the power of the presidency and increase the power of the people. While I am in office, you the people will have control over as much presidential power as possible.
I am in favor of limiting government, and the best way to do so is to give the people the power to limit it.

Constitutional amendment
Ultimately, America needs to enshrine the national voter referendum and voter veto into the constitution, and enable rules for limiting presidential power. What exact form this constitutional amendment will take will be decided through national voter referendum.

Why run for president?
Empowering the people, we are not children. Representative government is archaic and insulting.

Campaign
Not taking any donations at all. 
I’m not going to campaign. Campaigning and asking for donors leads to generally mental people running for president. It’s a generally sickening activity. I mean, who wants to do that?
All I ask is for people to volunteer, get together and create petitions to submit for listing me on their state’s presidential ballot. That’s it.


What will I do as president.
I will do what you want. The first thing I will do is enable individuals to sign up to vote securely online. Any legislation that is passed by the house and senate will be put to a vote. We will potentially put the vote out prior to the house or senate vote so that they can see what will occur. 


Who am I

I’ve been a musician since I was 10 years old. I am a rancher and a software engineer. I currently reside on a small ranch in Cottonwood, Arizona. I don’t actually want to be president, I want to reduce the power of the presidency.
I am not running as a member of either party and my personal views are really of little consequence. I will not be making the decisions as president, I will be allowing the people to do so.
My wife is a midwife and has spent her life working to help mom’s and babies. She is the founder of the Eats on Feets human milk sharing network.
